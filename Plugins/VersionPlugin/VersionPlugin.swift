/*
 This is a Swift Package Manager (SPM) build tool plugin.

 What it does:
 - When you build the package, it reads the version number from the file named "VERSION"
 in the root of the package.
 - It then generates a Swift file called "Version.swift" in the plugin's working directory.
 - The generated file contains a simple `LibraryInfo` enum with a static property `version`,
 so you can easily access the library's version number in your code.

 Why:
 - This way, you donâ€™t need to hardcode the version in multiple places.
 - The version is managed in one central file (VERSION), making it easy to update.

 Example:
 If VERSION file contains "1.2.3", then Version.swift will look like:

 public enum LibraryInfo {
 public static let version = "1.2.3"
 }
